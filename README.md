# Benchmark of ARXâ€™s Heuristic Algorithms
Benchmark of ARX's heuristic algorithms and further approaches for anonymizing high-dimensional data.

## Workflow
**Benchmark:**  
The **Java** code contained in this repository can be used to run the benchmarks. The used datasets and the corresponding generalization hierarchies are located in the folders **data** and **hierarchies**. The benchmark results are provided as CSV-files and can be found in the **results** folder.  

**Visualization:**  
The **Python** code can be used to analyze and visualize the CSV-files contained in **results**. The figures generated by the script can be found in the **figures** folder.

## Contents
The content of each sub-directory is briefly described below. Additionally, each subdirectory contains its own readme file for further information.

**data:** Datasets that were used as input for the experiments. [README](data/README.md)  
**hierarchies:** Generalization hierarchies used for the experiments to specify how attribute values can be altered [README](hierarchies/README.md)  
**java:** Java code required to run the anonymization experiments. [README](java/README.md)  
**results:** Results obtained from running the experiments. [README](results/README.md)  
**python:** Python code used to analyze and visualize the results. [README](python/README.md)  
**figures:** Figures obtained from visualizing the results of the experiments. [README](figures/README.md)
