For each experiment a method capable of plotting the result is available. They are provided with a path to the results-file and the output destination of the figure.
The methods used for plotting refer to the experiments described in the paper as follows:

| Method | Description  |
|-|-|
draw_experiment1 | Anonymization of **low-dimensional** datasets using **global generalization**
draw_experiment2 | Anonymization of **high-dimensional** datasets using **global generalization** 
draw_experiment3 | Anonymization of **high-dimensional** datasets using **local generalization**
